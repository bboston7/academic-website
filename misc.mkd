I have a weekly radio show on [WMBR](https://wmbr.org) from midnight to 1am
Thursday nights (Friday mornings?) called
[Abstractions](http://wmbr.org/www/sched-thu#show4925).
If you keep a more normal sleep schedule for some reason you can listen to old
episodes on [the archives](http://wmbr.org/cgi-bin/arch?sort=name).
Occasionally I'll recommend music on [my
tumblog](http://funsafemath.tumblr.com).

I made a website that generates poetry in the style of a given poet.
It's cleverly named [poem-gen](http://poem-gen.brettboston.net).

[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/carl_cambridge) if you want way too
many updates about things that don't matter.
