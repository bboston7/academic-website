I have a weekly radio show on [WMBR](https://wmbr.org) from midnight to 1am
Thursday nights (Friday mornings?) called
[Abstractions](http://wmbr.org/www/sched-thu#show4925).
If you keep a more normal sleep schedule for some reason you can listen to old
episodes on [the archives](http://wmbr.org/cgi-bin/arch?sort=name).

I made a website that generates poetry in the style of a given poet.
It's cleverly named [poem-gen](http://poem-gen.brettboston.net).
If you want to generate poems without anyone knowing (and why _wouldn't_ you?)
poem-gen is also available as a [hidden
service](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en) at
[ff44zftawkqoyw7v.onion](http://ff44zftawkqoyw7v.onion/).

[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/carl_cambridge) if you want way too
many updates about things that don't matter.
