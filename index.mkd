I am a software engineer at the [Stellar Development
Foundation](https://stellar.org) where I primarily work on peer-to-peer
networking and consensus for [Stellar
Core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core).

I have previously worked as a research engineer focused on Programming
Languages, Software Assurance, and Computer Security at both
[Galois](https://galois.com) and [Aarno Labs](http://aarno-labs.com).

I completed my Masters in Computer Science studying Programming Languages at
MIT in 2018 under my advisor
[Michael Carbin](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/).

Before that, I was at the University of Washington working with
[Adrian Sampson](http://adriansampson.net)
under [Dan Grossman](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djg/) and
[Luis Ceze](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/).
