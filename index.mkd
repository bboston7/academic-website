I am a research engineer at [Galois](https://galois.com) where I work
on Programming Languages, Software Assurance, and Computer Security.
Before joining Galois, I worked as a research engineer at
[Aarno Labs](http://aarno-labs.com).

I completed my Masters in Computer Science studying Programming Languages at
MIT in 2018 under my advisor
[Michael Carbin](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/).

Before that, I was at the University of Washington working with
[Adrian Sampson](http://adriansampson.net)
under [Dan Grossman](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djg/) and
[Luis Ceze](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/).
